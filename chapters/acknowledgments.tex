First, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Patrignani. Then, I would like to thank my co-advisor Matthis Kruse, who has been extremely available during the past few months, and has offered me great help with the project, often steering my attention to the right problems to address, and helping me learn many things.

Additionally, I would like to thank my parents, Morena and Stefano, who supported me throughout this journey both financially and emotionally, helped me make important decisions along the way, and always encouraged me to pursue my academic goals.

Another acknowledgment goes to my siblings, Maddalena and Simone, whose company made my frequent returns home more enjoyable.

Finally, I want to thank my friends and colleagues from the San Bartolameo dorms and from my course, with whom I had the pleasure of sharing most of my time over the last three years.
